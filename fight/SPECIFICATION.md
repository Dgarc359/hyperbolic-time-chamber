Fight! is a simple single-player game.

You, the player, begin play with 50 hitpoints and 3 potions. Your enemy starts with 100 hitpoints.

You alternate turns playing. On your turn, you may either attack, dealing 10 damage, or drink a potion, consuming one potion and healing up to 30 hitpoints. You cannot heal above 50.

After you have either attacked or consumed a potion, the enemy will attack. This occurs even if the enemy has had their hitpoints reduced to 0. When the enemy attacks you, they deal 10 damage.

If you have 0 hitpoints at the beginning of your turn, you lose. If the enemy has 0 hitpoints, and you don't, you win. (Optional: bonus message for simultaneous death)
